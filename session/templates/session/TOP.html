      <h1><strong>FabControl Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>This privacy policy applies to all the FabControl products, services and websites under the FabControl.com, FabControl.app and FabControl.software domain names. We refer to those products, services and websites collectively as the “services”
        in
        this policy. Some services may have supplementary privacy statements that explain in more detail our specific privacy practices in relation to them. Unless otherwise noted, our services are provided by FabControl SIA.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2><strong>General</strong></h2>
      <p><br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your content is owned by you.&nbsp;FabControl treats your data as private. We don't sell it to anyone and we don’t use it for our own purposes, unless you give us permission to use particular data for the purposes of support or improving
          our
          services.</li>
        <li>We don’t share your email addresses and contact with anyone.</li>
        <li>We keep your data securely.&nbsp;FabControl and our technology providers use up-to-date encryption technologies and obey best practices in user security, network security and physical security.</li>
        <li>Project data is stored on servers located in European Union.&nbsp;FabControl will process your project data on your behalf and under your instructions, including the ones agreed to in this privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2><strong>Your data and information</strong></h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>1. What information (data) does FabControl collect?&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>When you use FabControl, we collect information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources. These are listed below. The sections afterward describe what we do with this information.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Information we collect directly from you:</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Account registration information.</strong>&nbsp;You need an FabControl account before you can use FabControl services. When you register for an account, we collect your name, password and email address.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Billing information.</strong>&nbsp;If you make a payment to FabControl, we require you to provide your billing details, such as a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment
        (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Account settings.</strong>&nbsp;You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your&nbsp;account settings page. For example, your notification settings.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Customer information.</strong>&nbsp;We allow you to store email addresses of your customers and associate email addresses with your projects, so you can assign orders and jobs to customers. We don't use these email addresses and
        associated data for our own purposes or email them.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Project data.</strong>&nbsp;We store your project data (order details, design files, g-code, images, texts, etc.) for you.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Other data you intentionally share.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts. For example, if you provide us with a testimonial, or a support request.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Usage data.</strong>&nbsp;We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services. This may include which pages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, our servers keep
        log
        files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Device data.</strong>&nbsp;We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Referral data.</strong>&nbsp;If you arrive at the FabControl website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Information from page tags.</strong>&nbsp;We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as&nbsp;web beacons) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites. This data
        includes usage and user statistics.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>2. How does FabControl use the information we collect?</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>We treat your projects and contributions as information that is private to you and your customers.&nbsp;We know that you need to keep your project and customer contributions (which we collectively refer to as “project data”) private. We do
        not
        use your project data for our own purposes, except in the limited circumstances described in this privacy policy or unless we have your express consent. We do not sell your project data to third parties. Generally, we use the information we
        collect from you in connection with providing our services to you and, on your behalf, to your project contributors.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Specific ways we use this information are listed below:</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To provide you with our services.</strong> This includes providing you with customer support, which requires us to access your information to assist you (such as with project creation or technical troubleshooting). If you choose to
        link
        your FabControl account to a third party account (such as Google account), we may use the information you allow us to collect from those third parties to provide you with additional features, services, and personalized content.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To manage our services.</strong>&nbsp;We internally use your information, including project data, for the following limited purposes:&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To monitor and improve our services and features.</strong>&nbsp;We internally perform statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags) to
        analyze
        and measure user behavior and trends, to understand how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our services. However, we do not use the non-public content of projects (i.e. the content of questions and responses
        that
        you have not publicly shared) for these purposes.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To assist the enforcement of our Terms of Use.</strong> Including, to prevent potentially illegal activities, to screen for undesirable or abusive activity.&nbsp;For example, we may enable automated systems that screen content for
        phishing activities, spam, and fraud.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To create new services, features or content</strong> (public data and metadata only).&nbsp;We may use public project data and anonymized project metadata (that is, data about the characteristics of a project but not it's content), to
        create and provide new services, features or content. For example, we may look at statistics like contribution numbers or length and publish interesting observations about these for informational or marketing purposes. When we do this,
        neither
        individual project creators nor contributors will be identified or identifiable unless we have obtained their permission.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To facilitate account creation and the logon process.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to link your FabControl account to a third party account (such as your Google account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those
        third
        parties to facilitate the account creation and login process.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To contact you about your service or account.</strong>&nbsp;We occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature (e.g. service-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to our services or policies, a
        welcome
        email when you first register). You can't opt out of these communications since they are required to provide our services to you.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To contact you for marketing purposes (if you opt in).</strong>&nbsp;We will only do this if you have given us your express permission to contact you for this purpose. For example, during the account registration process we will ask
        for
        your permission to use your information to contact you for promotional purposes. You may opt out of these communications at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in them, or changing the relevant setting on
        your&nbsp;FabControl&nbsp;page.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong>&nbsp;If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>3. With whom and when do we share or disclose your information?</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>The only times we will disclose or share your personal information or project data with a third party is when we have done one of three things, in accordance with applicable law: (a) given you notice, such as in this privacy policy; (b)
        obtained
        your express consent, such as through an opt-in checkbox; or (c) anonymized the information so that individuals cannot be identified by it. Where required by law, we will obtain your express consent prior to disclosing or sharing any personal
        information.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Our technology providers.</strong> We implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us,
        and
        handled in accordance with this privacy policy. By using our services, you authorize FabControl to sub-contract in this manner on your behalf. For example, we use payment processors who help us to process credit card transactions, e-mail
        service
        providers, web traffic analytic tools and other similar services.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>When required by law.</strong> We may disclose your information as required and permitted by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order,
        subpoena,
        or other legal process served on us.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>When you share or publish your projects.</strong>&nbsp;By default, your projects are private. You are able to control who can access and contribute to your project by&nbsp;changing your project sharing and publishing settings, and
        you
        may share or publish certain project types (like process paramaters) with other users of FabControl.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Your account details to your billing contact.</strong>&nbsp;If your details (as the account holder) are different to the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and account details to the billing
        contact
        upon their request (we also will attempt to notify you of such requests). By using our services and agreeing to this privacy policy, you consent to this disclosure.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Aggregated information to third parties to improve or promote our services.</strong>&nbsp;No individuals can be identified or linked to any part of the information we share with third parties to improve or promote our services.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>If there's a change in business ownership or structure.</strong>&nbsp;If ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, or we undertake a corporate reorganization (including a merger or consolidation) or any other
        action
        or transfer between FabControl entities, you expressly consent to FabControl transferring your information to the new owner or successor entity so that we can continue providing our services. If required, FabControl will notify the applicable
        data protection agency in each jurisdiction of such a transfer in accordance with the notification procedures under applicable data protection laws.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Information you expressly consent to be shared.</strong>&nbsp;For example, we may expressly request your permission to provide your contact details to third parties for various purposes, including to provide additional
        services.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>4. What are your rights to your information?</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>You can:&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Update your account details.</strong>&nbsp;You can update your registration and other account information on your&nbsp;account page. Information is updated immediately.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Download your project data.</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Edit data and manage your project data.</strong> You can edit or store your project data using FabControl services and store project data in accordance with pricing plan chosen by you.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Delete your project data.</strong>&nbsp;Deleting project data will not permanently delete project data immediately. As long as you maintain an account with us, we retain your deleted data in case you delete something by accident and
        need
        to restore it (which you can request by contacting&nbsp;customer support via support@fabcontrol.com). To the extent permitted by law, we will permanently delete your data if you request to cancel your account.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Cancel your account.</strong>&nbsp;To cancel and delete your account, please contact&nbsp;support@fabcontrol.com. Deleting your account will cause all the project data in the account to be permanently deleted, as permitted by law,
        and
        will disable your access to any services that require FabControl account. We will respond to any such request, and any appropriate request to access, correct, update or delete your personal information within the time period specified by law
        (if
        applicable) or without excessive delay. We will promptly fulfill requests to delete personal data unless the request is not technically feasible or such data is required to be retained by law (in which case we will block access to such data,
        if
        required by law). For how long do we retain your data?&nbsp;We generally retain your data for as long as you have an account with us, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. Data that is deleted
        from
        our servers may remain as residual copies on offsite backup media for up to approximately 12 months afterward.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>5. Security, cookies and other important information</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Changes to this privacy policy.</strong>&nbsp;We may modify this privacy policy at any time, but if we do so, we will notify you by publishing the changes on this website. If we determine the changes are material, we will provide you
        with additional, prominent notice as is appropriate under the circumstances, such as via email. For any changes to this privacy policy for which you are required to provide prior consent, we will provide you with reasonable notice of such
        changes
        before they become effective and provide you with the opportunity to consent to those changes. If you do not cancel your subscription and continue to use our services beyond the advance-notice period, you will be considered as having
        expressly
        consented to the changes in our privacy policy. If you disagree with the terms of this privacy policy or any updated privacy policy, you may close your account at any time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;We are committed to handling your personal information and data with integrity and care. However, regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a technical risk that your
        personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting and transmitting your data through the internet.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;We use cookies on our websites. Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users. Each cookie expires after a certain period of time,
        depending
        on what we use it for. We use cookies for several reasons:</p>
      <p>a. To make our site easier to use.&nbsp;If you use the "Remember me" feature when you sign into your account, we may store your username in a cookie to make it quicker for you to sign in whenever you return to FabControl. b. For security
        reasons.&nbsp;We use cookies to authenticate your identity, such as confirming whether you are currently logged into FabControl. c. To provide you with personalized content.&nbsp;We may store user preferences, such as your default language,
        in
        cookies to personalize the content you see. d. To improve our services.&nbsp;We use cookies to measure your usage of our websites and track referral data, as well as to occasionally display different versions of content to you. This
        information
        helps us to develop and improve our services and optimize the content we display to users. We don't believe cookies are sinister, but you can still choose to remove or disable cookies via your browser. Refer to your&nbsp;web browser's
        configuration documentation&nbsp;to learn how to do this. Please note that doing this may adversely impact your ability to use our services. Enabling cookies ensures a smoother experience when using our services. By using our services and
        agreeing to this privacy policy, you expressly consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy. e. Online Tracking.&nbsp;We currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track" signal or other similar mechanism
        that
        indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our websites or use our services (unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy statement). • Safety of Minors and COPPA.&nbsp;Our services are not intended
        for
        and may not be used by minors. "Minors" are individuals under the age of majority in their place of residence. FabControl does not knowingly collect personal data from minors or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we
        have
        collected personal data from a minor, we may delete this information without notice.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>6. Additional information for European Union users</strong></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>"Personal data".</strong>&nbsp;For users located in the EU, references to "personal information" in this policy are equivalent to what is commonly referred to as "personal data" in the EU.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>IP addresses.</strong>&nbsp;Our servers record the incoming IP addresses of visitors to our websites (whether or not the visitor has a FabControl account) and store the IP addresses in log files. We use these log files for purposes
        such
        as system administration and maintenance, record keeping, tracking referring web sites, inferring your location, and security purposes (e.g. controlling abuse, spam and DDOS attacks). We also store IP addresses along with certain actions you
        take
        on our system.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Data controller.</strong>&nbsp;FabControl SIA, whose contact information is listed in Impressum, is the data controller for registration, billing and other account information that we collect from users in the EU. However, the data
        controller for project data is the project creator. The project creator determines how their project data is used and disclosed. FabControl only processes such project data in accordance with the instructions and permissions (including those
        given under this privacy policy) selected by the project creator when they create and administer their project.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Accessing and correcting your personal data.</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to access and correct the personal information that FabControl holds about you. This right may be exercised through by visiting your account's&nbsp;page or
        by
        emailing <a href="mailto:support@fabcontrol.com" target="_blank">support@fabcontrol.com</a>.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><strong>Your responsibilities.</strong>&nbsp;By using our services, you agree to comply with applicable data protection requirements with regards to your project data, such as requirements to inform contributors about the specific uses and
        disclosures of their data.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2><strong>Consents</strong></h2>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>By clicking "I Agree" or any other button indicating your acceptance of this privacy policy, you expressly consent to the following:</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>• You consent to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your personal data in the manner described in this privacy policy, including our procedures relating to&nbsp;cookies, IP addresses and log files.</p>

      <p><br></p>
      <p>• You consent and agree that we may transfer your data to data processors located in countries, including the United States of America, which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries
        in
        the European Economic Area. Your consent is voluntary, and you may revoke your consent by opting out at any time. Please note that if you opt-out, we may no longer be able to provide you our services.</p>
